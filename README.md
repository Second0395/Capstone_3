# Olympics

I think the olympics as an event is so interesting in itself. It's pretty much the biggest event in the world, so there is bound to be some interesting things regarding its logistics.

# Light pollution

Light pollution is an interesting phenomenon. It blocks visibility for people in highly populated areas, if there is enough light to do so. GADM has a good database where I can pull data from specific countries, so I could analyze the content of America or some of the countries in North America. I will most likely have to use Geopandas
