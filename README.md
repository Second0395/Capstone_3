We all know that there are differences between 1 star ratings and 5 star ratings. No matter what website you go on, there is a general understanding that 5 star means the product or service met or even exceeded your expectations, and a 1 star rating means that it did not. 

But what is the case for 2,3, and 4 star ratings? Depending on the person, there's a wide range of things that people would consider a 2 star rating, per say. For a lot that could mean "slightly better than 1 star" or depending on the person's mood that day, maybe a slight defect in the product could change their rating from 5 stars to 2 stars. In general, it's hard to draw a line between the middle ratings, as the way people approach rating them varies a lot as well. That being said, is there perhaps a pattern in the language that people use depending on the rating they give?

That is what this project focuses on. Using both a classification and a regression model, it will explore some insights we can gather from constructing these models.
